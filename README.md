# Welcome to Felo Docs

Here you can edit the pages and create a pull request so that I can implement your changes. Here’s a little tutorial:

1. Download GitHub Desktop [here](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32).
2. Download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-x64-user).
3. Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.18.2/node-v18.18.2-x64.msi).
4. Download Git [here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.42.0.windows.2/Git-2.42.0.2-64-bit.exe).
5. Open GitHub Desktop and log in with your GitHub account.
6. Click on "File -> Clone Repository" and then click on "URL". Enter `https://github.com/Felitendo/Docs`.
7. Click "Clone" and wait for it to finish cloning.
8. Click on "Open in VSCode".
9. Click on "Terminal -> New Terminal" and enter `npm i`.
10. Wait for everything to install, then enter `npm i react-player`.
